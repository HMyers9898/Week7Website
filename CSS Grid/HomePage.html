                <p>The Scouts risk their lives on every mission outside the wall for the sake of humanity.
                    The purpose of these mission is to try to further understand the enemy, titans. Humans 
                    do not know the origin of titans, and that is why we must leave the saftey of the walls. 
                    If you have any interest in joining the Scouts, think about contacting us or leaving your name and number
                     for more information.</p>

                <h2>Map of the only safe space for humans</h2>
                <p>100 years ago, before the titans attacked, humans roamed free there were no places we could not go. The titans
                    wiped out 90% of humanity, those of us who survived live behind the wall. We are sitting ducks waiting for the 
                    day the titans decide to attack and devour humans again causing humanity to go extint. 
                    You can help is find the answer to our eminent doom, and prevent it, by joining the Scouts.

            <h2>Titans beyond the wall</h2>
            <p>Pictured above are just a few of the infamous titans. From this picture you might be thinking, "They dont 
                look too hard to kill.". That is until you realize just how tall they are, the small ones in front are 6 meters
                tall, while the ones in the back are 12 to 15 meters tall and they run, fast. They are mindless creatures and eat humans for 
                the sake of the kill. They do not have digestive tracks so they end up disposing of what they eat in other ways.
                Joining the Scouts will not only teach you more than you have ever known about tians, we will teach you how to 
                kill one. Make a differnce in the future of humanity, join us.
